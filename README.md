# Endpoints used by [mobile app](https://github.com/toilets4london/ToiletAppiOS)

- GET all toilets `/toilets/?page_size=2000` (increase `page_size` if there are > 2000 toilets in the database)
- POST star rating { 'toilet' : *valid toilet id* , 'rating': *1-5 star rating* } `/ratings/`
- POST report a toilet { 'toilet' : *valid toilet id* , 'reason' : *valid reason code, see below* , 'other_description' : *text describing problem* } `/reports/`

| Problem                               | Report reason code |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| This toilet does not exist            | "DNE"              |
| This toilet is very poorly maintained | "O"                |

### Creating an account (allows you to post more ratings / reports per day if you use the Authorization header)

- POST sign up { 'email' : *your email* , 'password' : *your password* } `/auth/users/`
- POST obtain api token { 'email' : *your email* , 'password' : *your password* } `/auth/token/login/`
- POST forgot password { 'email' : *your email* } `/reset-password/`
- POST reset password with token received by email { 'token' : *token in email* , 'password' : *your new password* } `/reset-password/confirm/`
- With an API token you can then use the header { 'Authorization' : *token [valid api token]* } for POST endpoints (`/ratings/` and `/reports/` )
